 To Do List:
	+	Add function to find LAN servers via broadcast.
    +   Modify main structure to use a StackLayout for the server display.  Each game will have its own 
    	server table.  When mods or game types are selected, filters will be applied to the server table
        to only show the appropriate servers.
    +   Allow the same master URL to be included more than once for each game.  This can be useful if the
        user wants to have different protocol configurations available.  For instance, if the user wants
        to only see 1.32 Q3 servers, he can enable a master server that is set up to only query for 
        protocol 68, and disable the standard master that has queries for all protocols.
	+	Would be cool to display a window that lists the changes in the new version 
	+	Separate maps from the application
	+	Create installation package with IzPack and PackJacket.
	+	Implement join triggers
	+	Allow unknown servers to be sorted.
	+	Don't allow connection to an unknown server, or at least warn the user and give
		him the opportunity to do it anyway.
	+	Check for the number of open player slots during join.  Give warning dialogue if no
		open slots.
	+	Create friends lists by game.  Allow to add friends by right clicking on players in servers.
	+	Create a function to find friends by searching through all servers in the current game for 
		matches (case insensitive) in the friends list for that game.  Create a "Friends" folder 
		(non-persistent) and copy servers that have friends to them.  Friends folder should be updated 
		every time the servers are refreshed.
	+	Implement player search function that searches for a particular name (requires user input) in 
		any servers in the currently selected game.
	+   Help menu option to check for updates.
	+   New User Preferences:
	        +   Allow server auto update of currently selected game (input frequency in minutes)
			+	Create option to discard (or not list) unknown servers
