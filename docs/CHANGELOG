2009-06-29      Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+   Show splash screen (overridden by command line argument)
	+   AKM Action on join (radio buttons): exit, minimize to tray, none
	+	Check for updates on startup

2009-06-28      Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
    +   Check for program updates, prompt user for download, open browser to 
        project page.

2009-06-27      Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Created About dialog.
	+	Update GeoIP database.
	+	Created User Preferences dialog.
	+	Added defaultPort to Games.  It is stored in games.xml and loaded by
		GamesLoader.  Used in Add Server dialog to provide the default value
		for the server port.
	+	Created function to add an arbitrary server by IP address/port to a folder.
		This option appears on the folder pop up menu.
	+	Added languages.xml and LanguageLoader class to load languages into an
		array list.  This is used to select the language from the user preferences
		dialog.  New languages can be added without any coding changes.

2009-06-26      Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Arbitrary servers can now be added to servers with DND.

2009-06-25      Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
    +   Coded folder functionality.  Users can add as many folders as they wish and
        remove them again at will from the gameTree popup.  Servers are added to 
        folders from the serverTable popup.  Servers can be removed from folders from 
        the popup at will.
        
    +   If usergames.xml is not found, it will automatically be created.  If no games
        are found installed in the default locations in gamedefaults.xml, then a setup
        dialog will be opened automatically to allow the user to make changes.
         
    +   Revised XML configuration files.  "gamedefaults.xml" was added.  It contains all
        default game settings and is used to build "usergames.xml".

    +   Created GameSetupDialog class to allow user to modify game configuration from the
        default values.  All settings are now configurable, including game engines and
        master servers.
        
    +   Created GameDefaultsLoader class to load settings from gamedefaults.xml.
    
    +   Created UserGamesWriter class to save changes to game configurations to 
        usergames.xml.
    
    +   Reconfigured main menu.
    
    +   Changed the gameTree and serverTable popup menus to be constructed dynamically
        based on the type tree element selected.

2009-02-02		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Moved DTDs to separate files in preparation for code that updates XML files to
		make the definition separate from the data.

2009-01-29		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Created new classes IgnoreItem and IgnoreList.  Changed Game.ignoreList from 
		VarList to IgnoreList.  VarList requires unique	attributes, but multiple entries 
		for the same attribute can exist for ignored items (e.g. - more than one mod can 
		be ignored for a particular game, as is	the case for UrT within	Quake 3).

2008-12-18		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Fixed a bug that caused a crash (null mod reference) when trying to join a server
		in a folder without first updating the folder. 

v0.1.2
2008-12-10		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Added additional map images for UrT4.

2008-12-09		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Redirected stdout and stderr to the log file, if file logging is enabled.
	+	Dynamically resize the canvas for the map image according to the image's aspect
		ratio.  Always maintain a width of 200 pixels (though this is completely arbitrary).
	+	Added ability to ignore servers based on specific attributes.  Currently only 
		"mod" and "engine" are programmed, but it's trivial to add others by modifying
		games.xml (to include other possible values in the DTD) and by adding the new
		attribute to the isIgnored method in the Game class.
	+	Moved log files to platform-specific user directories ("user.home"\Application Data\
		All Knowing Mind\log\ on Windows and "user.home"/.akm/log/ on Linux).

2008-12-07		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Removed game discriminator code. It didn't work out as anticipated.
	+	Added game execution by server engine. Moved the start command and working
		directory into a new <start> element in usergames.xml. Multiple start commands 
		can be listed for any game using the server engine reported by the server to
		trigger which client to start. If an engine isn't specified, it defaults to the
		value "default". 
		
2008-12-06		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Fixed the disappearing unknowns bug.
	+	Added ignore options to games.xml: <ignore> and <ignoreothers />. <ignore> will
		allow the application to discard servers by mod name. For instance, 
		<ignore>q3ut4</ignore> for a particular game will cause it to discard any servers 
		with a game discriminator of q3ut4. <ignoreothers /> will cause the	app to ignore 
		all discriminators not specifically identified.
	+	Added game discriminator feature.  Default discriminator is mod.  Other option is
		server engine, though others can be added as necessary.
	+	Made UrT4 a standalone game.  It now uses the game engine as a discriminator to
		segregate the ioUrbanTerror servers from the id Quake 3 servers.  This can be
		changed in games.xml and usergames.xml if this behavior is not desired.		

2008-12-05		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Fixed bug with icons for servers in folders not getting updated during selected 
		server query. Refresh all on a folder will change icon to unknown if it can't be
		found, which is probably not a bad idea as the user will see that fact.


v0.1.1	2008-11-28	Fixed minor bug causing Linux version to crash

2008-11-28		Brian Rapp <dilireus@speakeasy.net>
	+	Fixed Linux crash bug.


v0.1.0	2008-11-26	Initial public release
