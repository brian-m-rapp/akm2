<P>AKM is a multi-language FPS game server browser. AKM is written in Java, making it operating system agnostic. 
It should run on any platform that has a JVM available and is supported by the SWT GUI library. There are multiple
install packages because the SWT library is specific to the OS and JVM.</p>
<p><u><b>Licensing</b></u></p>
<p>
AKM is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. It is open source and is free in both 
senses of the word. It is free as in beer (gratis) and free as in speech (libre). The source code is available
for download from the project home page: 
 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/allknowingmind/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/allknowingmind/</a>. You can modify the source code any way you like, but you
are required to offer your changes back to the project.
</p>
<p><u><b>What's New in version 0.2?</b></u></p>
<p>
This version includes most of the functionality that was missing from the previous version. It also has an
installer to make installation a breeze. The GeoIP database has been updated. New features include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game autodetect</li>
<li>Game configuration dialog</li>
<li>Game engine configuration</li>
<li>Master server configuration</li>
<li>Per-game customizable folders</li>
<li>Add arbitrary servers by IP address</li>
<li>Drag and drop servers into folders</li>
<li>User preferences dialog</li>
</ul>
<P><U><b>Supported Games</b></U></P>
<P>AKM currently supports:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Urban Terror</LI>
<LI>Quake 3</LI>
<LI>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</LI>
<LI>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</LI>
<LI>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</LI>
<LI>Nexuiz</LI>
<LI>OpenArena</LI>
<LI>World of Padman</LI>
<LI>Warsow</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The Half Life games and their derivatives, the Battlefield series, and the CoD games will eventually be
supported. Any games that use id's Quake 3 protocols should be trivial to add without any code changes.
If you want support for additional games, please submit a feature request via the project website.</P>
<p>
<u><b>Installation</b></u></p>
<p>
A JRE version 1.5 or later must be installed. In Windows, you should be able to just double click on the
jar file that you downloaded. You may get a warning popup indicating you need a Java development environment,
but you can ignore this. It will still install.</p>
<p>To start installation in Linux, open a terminal window, cd to the directory containing the installation jar 
file, and type:</p>
<code>java -jar akm-install-&lt;version&gt;</code>.jar
<p>Installation is fairly self-explanatory. The biggest decision you need to make is where to install AKM. 
You can also choose to install shortcuts on your desktop and/or in the start menu. In the menu, it will be 
installed in "Games" by default. It is recommended that you install the shortcuts and use them to launch AKM
rather than creating your own.</p>
<p><u><b>*************IMPORTANT LINUX NOTE***************</b></u></p>
<p>
After you have completed the installation, you <i>must</i> give the akm.jar file execute permission. For some
reason, the installer doesn't do it, though it's supposed to. To set the permissions, Open a terminal window,
cd to the AKM installation directory (~/akm by default), and type:</p>
<code>chmod +x akm.jar</code>
<p>You will then be able to launch AKM with the shortcuts.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Uninstallation</b></u></p>
An uninstall jar file is created by default in the Uninstall subdirectory of your installation directory. To
completely uninstall AKM, open a terminal window, cd to the Uninstall directory, and type the command:</p>
<code>java -jar uninstall.jar</code>
<P>
<b><u>Game Configuration</u></b></P>
<P>
The first time you run AKM, it will attempt to find the supported games in their default locations. On
Windows platforms, those will be whatever the default installation directory is for the particular game. 
On Linux platforms, AKM will look in /usr/local. Any games found will automatically be enabled, as will 
all of their mods. If no games are found in the default locations, then the game configuration dialog 
will appear allowing you to choose which games are installed and where they are located. For a game to 
appear in the tree on the left side of the display, 'Show Game' must be checked. You can display games 
even if they are not installed. If you want to be able to launch a game from AKM, then it must be installed 
at the location indicated, and 'Game Installed' must be checked. You can also decide which mods you want 
to display.</p>
<p>
You should not modify any of the game engine or master server settings unless you have a very specific 
reason for doing so. However, if you play Quake 3, you may want to restrict the servers to protocol 68. 
All protocol versions are displayed by default, but you will need a version switcher program, such as 
<a href="http://www.quaketweaks.com/version.html">this one</a> (for Windows only) to be able to play 
all versions. 
</p>
<p><u><b>Recovery</b></u></p>
If you make any changes that make it impossible to scan for servers or launch a particular game, you can
delete usergames.xml and AKM will rebuild it to the default values.  usergames.xml is located in the
data subdirectory under the installation directory. Do not modify or delete any other files in that 
directory or you may render AKM unusable.
<p>
<b><u>Notes on Urban Terror 4</u></b></p>
<p>
Urban Terror 4 is configured as a standalone game. This default configuration will launch the ioUrbanTerror 
client if the server is an ioq3 server and it will launch the quake3 client if the server is a Q3 server. 
You can change this behavior if you only have one of the two clients installed by removing the game engine(s) 
entries that you don't have installed using the game configuration dialog. For instance, if you don't have 
Quake 3 installed, remove all entries except for the ioq3 entry. If you don't have ioq3 installed, remove 
all of the entries that use it and only leave the q3 entry.</p>
<P>
<U>System Requirements</U></P>
<P>
Windows XP or Linux (Mac OS X to be supported in a future release). It very well may work on other versions of 
Windows, but it hasn't been tested.</P>
<P>Java 1.5 Standard Edition is required at a minimum.</P>
<P><U><b>Directory Structure</b></U></P>

<P>The log file is in ~/.akm.</P>
<P><B>Windows:</B></P>
<P>The default installation directory is C:\Program&nbsp;Files\The&nbsp;All-Knowing&nbsp;Mind\. The base directory has the

<P>The log file is in C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application&nbsp;Data\Dilireum\The&nbsp;All-Knowing&nbsp;Mind.</P>
<p>If you want to create your own Desktop shortcut from scratch, the easiest way is to create a new shortcut to 
javaw.exe. Then select the the shortcut properties and append "-jar org.dilireum.akm.jar" to the Target, and 
change the "Start in:" field to "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\The&nbsp;All-Knowing&nbsp;Mind".
Alternatively, you can simply create a shortcut to "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\The&nbsp;All-Knowing&nbsp;Mind\akm.bat", 
but you will have to put up with an annoying extra DOS window if you do.</p>
<P><B>OS X:</B></P>
<P>I have no idea. My knowledge of the Mac wouldn't fill the back of a business card. If you want OS X supported, 
let's talk.</P>
<p>
<u><b>Map Images</b></u></p>
<p>
You can add additional map images as you like. All map files must be jpeg format. They will automatically be 
compressed to 200x200. The file name must match the map name as reported by servers. You should make use all
lower case since AKM will translate all map names reported by servers to lowercase before attempting to find
a matching file name.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Reporting Bugs</b></u></p>
<p>
AKM is now fully functional, but it is still in the pre-alpha development phase and there <em>will</em> be bugs. 
If you find any, please report them here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=add&amp;group_id=243818&amp;atid=1123681">http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=add&amp;group_id=243818&amp;atid=1123681</a>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Provide as much detailed information as possible to help us track it down. There is a log file for AKM in ~/.akm/log on
Linux platforms and in C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Dilireum\The All-Knowing Mind\log on Windows 
machines. Any stack trace from the log file plus a description of what you were doing when it crashed would be helpful.</P>
<P>If you would like to contribute, I'm looking for talent, whether it be doing language translations, testing, 
creating map images, web site design, graphics, researching game protocols, or hard core hacking.</P>
